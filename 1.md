- Moon Modeler
- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- Connection: Mongoose helps you establish a connection to your MongoDB database. It acts as a bridge between your Node.js application and the MongoDB server.
- Schema: Mongoose allows you to define a schema for your data. A schema is like a blueprint that specifies the structure of your data. It defines the fields, their types, and any constraints
- Model: Once you've defined a schema, you can use it to create a model. A model is like a constructor function that you use to create documents (data entries) that adhere to the schema.
